# World Cup Player Analysis for Catching Media Bias

# Context
This was my semester project for Intro to Data Science taken at Colorado School of Mines. I used a kaggle dataset to try and compare players purely based off of statistics. Many journalists and sports companies make their list of best players at each tournament and there is almost always bias in their decisions. My goal was to try and find players that have been overlooked because they weren't as popular going into the World Cup or because their countries aren't one of the big names in soccer. I found that there were a lot of players overlooked for the reasons previously mentioned and this can be shown in their market value and their lack of recognition by mainstream media. There were many players who had similar or better stats than those with big names yet they still have not been rewarded for their preformances.  

# Background
Soccer has been a huge part of my life since I was very little growing up in an Argentinian family soccer was always on the TV and there was always a lot of passion whenever Argentina was playing. The world cup I chose to analyze was the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar where Argentina actually won the tournament and that experience was one of the best of my life so far. Knowing this I went into this project predicting that I would be surprised by the results since I myself have bias towards Argentina and I will defend them with everything in me. The results did end up proving my prediction correct and showed me my bias, hopefully in the future more projects like this one are created and made available to the public to help spread statistically backed facts instead of biased ones. 

# Project Video
There is a video that was my submission for my final project in the class which I presented my findings. There was a time limit of 10 minutes and I went over the time by quite a bit but I had to cut out a lot of my analysis. These are topics I'm very passionate about (soccer and data) and I could've talked about it for hours.

# Code 
One day I'd like to revisit this and try and achieve the same goal with some more advanced skills (Possibly AI or machine learning) and add different types of visualization.

Thank you for taking the time to check out my project!
